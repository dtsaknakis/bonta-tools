- Description: An example library created for educational purposes.
- My notes on the process of creating a JavaScript library, building it
  with TypeScript, and publishing it to npmjs.org 
  [can be found in the 'notes' folder](notes/)

The library exports code in both CommonJS (ES5) and ESModules (ES6), so
that the library consumer can select his prefered way depending on his
project.
